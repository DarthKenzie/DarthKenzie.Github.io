In this lesson of Fuze me and Vincent were 'creating' space invaders and making emoji sentences out of them the sentence we made was, I hate space invaders, we had to create the hate which was in the form of an X, we used the diagram of the space invader to help make the X which was quite easy but we didn’t actually get the full form of it there was a two by two in the middle</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I’m not asking many questions when I’m stuck on a hard part and when i ask i tend to get through much quicker than not asking but if i ask too much it will limite my learning as I’m not learning myself I’m just asking for ‘answers’ in this case.I was also spinning around on my chair again and not paying attention to Vincent who was asking for the code</td>

    <td>Next time i will try and get to work straight away and not hesitating to get the fuze box and accessories, I need to remember to use the pen drive to save my work as well as I can’t hope that vincent has it on his pen drive all the time as we did have one time it didn’t save but luckily we had finished that stage</td>
