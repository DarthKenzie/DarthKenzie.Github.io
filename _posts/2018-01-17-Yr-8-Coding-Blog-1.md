    <td>I learnt by following the instructions in booklet and trying others ways as the program I am on isn't quite the same to the booklet. Another effective strategy I learned was trying it again if I didn’t succeed.At one point in the lesson me and my partner (Vincent) were stuck figuring out how to start  the 'Fuze Basic’ as we were clicking on the folder that said Fuze basic instead of trying to click on the one above which i can’t quite remember the name of.</td>

    <td>Not stopping when told, this makes me lose concentration and a might not catch something important the teacher might’ve said. I frequently spin around on my chair whilst the teacher is important, I never know if i could be picked on to answer a question so I will be working on that in the next lesson. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Listen carefully to the Mr Ampah-Korsah and pay attention while other pupils are talking as they could say something very useful. I’ll improve my learning by continuing to try other techniques for problems i face and of course stop spinning around on the chair.</td>
