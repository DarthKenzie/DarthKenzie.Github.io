    <td>In this lesson I learnt by trying again and again, as always but this time we were improving and there wasn't much need to try again. I’d say it was about 1/10 of the time we had to try again and when we did it was no more than one try. Another effective strategy was paying careful attention to the instructions.</td>

    <td>I need to still work on getting the fuze box and accessories much quicker as sometimes I think I’m not allowed and that slows us down, I can also go to the coding clubs and improve my blogs before the next week, I’m going to go there and try and make my blog  transparent or make the writing bigger</td>
