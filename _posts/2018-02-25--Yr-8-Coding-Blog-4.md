    <td>In this lesson me and vincent were 'creating' space invaders and letters/shapes on fuze and making form a message e.g i love space invaders. After this we tried to make our own letter/shape to rewrite this ‘sentence’ and we ended failing the first idea and so we tried again and noticed what we did wrong and corrected it it ended up being, i hate space invaders, the ‘hate’ in the form of an X.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Getting started quickly is definitely a habit to work on, it will make us able to get more done and have more turns ‘navigating’ the ‘typer’. The thing that limited my learning most was looking at other people's work as i found it interesting, rather than concentrating on vincent and what he’s trying to tell me/ what i'm meant to be telling him.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Last week i completed my ‘task’ of collecting the fuze box and accessories much quicker and that’s a reason we got to the stage we’re at the moment not only from effort and endless… trying again and again but the speed to get started.</td>
