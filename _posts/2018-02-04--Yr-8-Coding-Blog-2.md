    <td>I learnt by trying different things and by working together with Vincent, when working together it was much more effective than one of us just repeatedly failing and not completing it as he/one is getting stressful which will only end up in failure, however when we work together there are two brains instead of one and is much more effective as you're working as a team and tryin other ways one of us might’ve not have thought about.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Same thing as last week pay close attention when people are talking and stop when told to is quite important as it links up to listening to others, the lack of creativity we/I use in coding as i’m repeatedly trying the same code to run rather than looking for the mistakes.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pay close attention to when others are talking and also quitting the habit of spinning around in the chair as that is not what they are meant to be used for. One other thing i will change is trying to figure out how exactly to put the coding on to the pen drive as we’re not so sure if it’s saving or not.</td>
