    <td>For this stage of fuze it was useful to read carefully and be careful what you do or don't put in because one time we had missed a semi-colon and it didn’t work so even the smallest mistakes can cause the whole thing not to work but it did give us an error and where to look so it was alright</td>

    <td>I’m not asking many questions when I’m stuck on a hard part and when i ask i tend to get through much quicker than not asking but if i ask too much it will limite my learning as I’m not learning myself I’m just asking for 'answers’ in this case.</td>
