    <td>In this lesson me and Vincente were a bit of the way in the electronic components kit and had done the first lighting part, we have now go onto the 6 flashing lights but we are a bit confused so we ended there last lesson we'll return to it the coming lesson and try to figure out why it’s not working. We mostly achieved what we did by looking closely at the images and by paying attention to the numbers on the breadboard.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was by fiddling around with the wires whilst putting them into the breadboard holes this meant they weren’t straight and then we think that’s why we couldn’t get the second (six lights) lighting part done.</td>

    <td>Looking to place the wires very carefully and trying not to bend them in the way that they might not work this could be major setback and we would like to get somewhere in the last lesson (next lesson).</td>
