    <td>In this lesson me and Vincent have nearly finished stage one and are nearly gone on to the electronic components kit, we have managed this by working as a team and not getting distracted , like other previous lessons. Another reason for this was that we got the fuze kit very quickly and didn't hesitate</td>

    <td>I need to still work on getting the fuze box and accessories much quicker as sometimes I think I’m not allowed and that slows us down, I can also go to the coding clubs and improve my blogs before the next week, I’m going to go there and try and make my blog  transparent or make the writing bigger, this I will have to do or it will result in a detention</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Pay close attention to when others are talking and trying to get the equipment much quicker, One other thing i will change is trying to figure out how exactly to put the coding on to the pen drive as we’re not so sure if it’s saving or not. </td>
